# Snooker Leaderboard Web App

## About

I created this web app to help solve a common problem: remembering snooker points during a game. With this app, players can easily keep track of their scores and display them on a leaderboard.

**Features:**
- Add and remove points from each player’s score.
- Track player names and update them dynamically.
- View scores live as the game progresses.

This web application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live demo of the app here: [SnookerLB](https://snookerlb.netlify.app/)

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter the names of the players (Player 1 and Player 2).
3. Use the “Add Points” and “Remove Points” buttons to track scores for each player.
4. The leaderboard will update automatically as you play.
